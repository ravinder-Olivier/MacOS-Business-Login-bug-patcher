# Methods
## Jamf Login Page
If you have a Jamf login page that is not working even after cloud password change, then, the oddly simple fix is that you just reset pram and nvram, then turn off WiFi and login. 
## Password Server Simple
Open recovery mode and reset password from there. 
## Microsoft Login Janky
Go to server admin screen and add even jankier commands, and manually allow the macos version number.
## Disk Dying
Your data is either dead or near dead. Try copying it. If it's dead or has died in middle of copy then oh well. Just put in a new drive, OWC or Apple or sketchy ebay, and do a clean install from there.
